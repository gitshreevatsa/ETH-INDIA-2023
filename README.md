## CCIP 
We are utilizing CCIP to call multiple chains to notify a token is honeypot on a particular chain. We have implemented this because we feel the future is cross chain and hence we will need to be able to cater to trades, swaps etc that are on cross chain dexes. Hence  dex on chain A can be cautious before swapping into a honeypot token on Chain B.

## Graph

We are utlizing graph protocol to fetch all the required addresses og token holders and LP addresses to understand reserves and total token holder strength for reporting the token.
